Welcome to my portfolio and research blog.

In this space, I will share insights and updates regarding my work in **computational biology**, specifically focusing on:

*   **Spatial Genomics**
*   **Graph Neural Networks**
*   **Single-cell Analysis**

I'm the creator of tools like `segger` and `SageNet`, which aim to solve complex problems in biological data analysis.

Stay tuned for more updates!
